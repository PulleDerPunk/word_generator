**This repository includes a word generator and a presentation on linguistics. I have also invented a new bad language.(by the way everything besides this text is in german)**

My extremely bad and cheap language ;)

* Word generator:
A small bad random generator which works with the [letter probabilities](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchstabenh%C3%A4ufigkeit) of the german language.

* Presentation(folder:GFS):
A presentation in Latin on the theme of linguistics
